\subsection*{Exercise 0.3 Programming Knowledge}
\subsubsection{i) General Programming Knowledge}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What does compiling \textit{source code} into machine code mean?}\\
    It means to transform the high-level human-readable code (like C++) into low-level machine code so that a computer's processor can execute it through the means of a compiler program.

    \item \textbf{What is the difference between compiling and interpreting source code?}\\
    Compiling transforms the entire code-base into machine-code before executing it (and then running the generated binary file) while interpreting only runs one line at a time.

    \item \textbf{What are the primitive/fundamental data types in programming languages?}\\
    Primitive data types are the most basic data-types. These often include: \texttt{char}, \texttt{int}, \texttt{float}, \texttt{bool}, and \texttt{double}.

    \item \textbf{What is the purpose of conditional statements?}\\
    These allow for conditions and off-branching which allows decision making on runtime.

    \item \textbf{What is branch prediction and what types of it exist in computing?}\\
    Way of optimizing the code when compiling it. The compiler can predict the outcome of a branch and take optimization steps.
    Types include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Static prediction
        \item Dynamic prediction
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{What is branchless programming? How can it help to reduce the runtime of the application?}\\
    It is a way of programming without using branches. It improves CPU instruction flow, therefore optimizing the programm itself.

    \item \textbf{Explain the concept of class inheritance.}\\
    Using Inheritance, a class can inherit aka copy attributes and methods and structure from another class (its parent class). It improves code structure.

    \item \textbf{What is encapsulation in the context of object-oriented programming?}\\
    With encapsulation, specific methods and attributes, meaning also data, can be inaccessible to certain other classes (e.g. public/private).

    \item \textbf{Describe the concepts of function- and operator-overloading.}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Function overloading}: multiple functions/methods with the same name but different parameters
        \item \textbf{Operator overloading}: redifining operators for custom types
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{What is memory allocation and why is it necessary?}\\
    Allocating memory is the process of reserving space in the memory for storing data for the program.

    \item \textbf{In compiler-based programming languages, what are the differences between run-time and compile-time evaluations? How does this impact high-performance computing?}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Compile-time}: the operations that are evaluated during compilation
        \item \textbf{Run-time}: the operations that are evaluated during runtime
    \end{itemize}
    Compile-Time evaluation is better for high-performance computing (reduces runtime overhead).

    \item \textbf{Name a programming language of your choice and list 5 primitive/fundamental data types of that language.}\\
    In \texttt{C++}, five primitive types are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{char}
        \item \texttt{int}
        \item \texttt{float}
        \item \texttt{double}
        \item \texttt{bool}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{What is a namespace and how is it useful?}\\
    Its an identifier that is usually a pre-/suffix to a name, grouping multiple together and keeping the program readable.

    \item \textbf{Explain the concept of variable scope.}\\
    Variable Scopes are the places where variables can be accessed from. by default a variable defined in a scope is not accessible from the parent scope. e.g. global can be used to make a variable accessible in all scopes of the program. these are often defined at the root of the program but dont necessarily have to be.

    \item \textbf{Explain the concept of variable lifetime.}\\
    the time for which a variable exists in memory. e.g. variables defined in the root scope usually exist throughout the runtime of the program while variables defined in a function only exist for the function call.

    \item \textbf{Explain Call-by-Value, Call-by-Reference, and Call-by-Pointer.}\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Call-by-Value}: copies the value of the argument to the function
        \item \textbf{Call-by-Reference}: passes the reference of the argument, making it able to change the original variable
        \item \textbf{Call-by-Pointer}: passes the memory address of the variable, making it possible to modify indirectly.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
