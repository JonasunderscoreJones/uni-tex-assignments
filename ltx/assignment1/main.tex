\section{A Journey With The Captain's Fellaz}\label{sec:history}
\subsection{Anchored at KQ}
KQ Entertainment, the agency behind \textit{ATEEZ} or Entertainment, as it is mostly referred to in the K-Pop industry, is a South-Korean company, founded by former \textit{JYP Enterntainment} Producer and Artist, \textit{Kim Kyu-wook}(김규욱) and quikly gained attention and presence in K-Pop, for fostering talent creating High-Quality music. The company is known for its innovative approach to approach to music production as well as artist development by placing a strong emphasis on creativity and innovation.

The small size and environment of KQ coupled with the overwhelming success of \textit{ATEEZ} demonstrates that success is possible without being one the three Giants (\textit{SM ENTERTAINMENT}, \textit{JYP ENTERTAINMENT} and \textit{HYBE LABELS}). It also gives \textit{ATEEZ} a unique character and charm that they likely wouldn't have developed had they debuted under a different, larger entertainment company. There have been, and continue to be, several successful groups and soloists who debuted under \textit{KQ}, including its most recent boy group, \textit{XIKERS}, which is already cultivating a global fanbase after having it's first . However, \textit{ATEEZ} remains the most prominent of them all.

\subsection{Story Of A Rookie Pirate}
Prior to \textit{ATEEZ}'s debut, the entertainment launched a Pre-Debut project known as \textit{KQ FELLAZ} which was a Pre-Debut Training-Group containing the Idols that would later be the members of \textit{ATEEZ}. The project fulfilled its purpose by promoting the company and the future idols, showcasing the members' individual talents. It allowed fans to familiarize themselves with their personalities, vocals, rap skills, and dance abilities before debut, laying a strong foundation and attracting thousands of loyal fans throughout it's initiative.

This careful pre-debut planning paid off, as \textit{ATEEZ} debuted with a strong and dedicated fanbase, eager to support the group’s journey. The \textit{KQ FELLAZ}'s exposure allowed fans to witness the chemistry between the members, laying the groundwork for \textit{ATEEZ}'s rise to stardom. \textit{KQ Entertainment}’s strategic approach to both artist development and fan engagement has been a key factor in ATEEZ’s success, as they were able to establish a sense of connection and loyalty with their audience from the very beginning, even before their initial debut, which is something not often witnessed with Rookie Groups.


\section{A Pirate's Story}\label{sec:backstory}
In their music videos, \textit{ATEEZ} conveys the conceptual narratives of a deep story which greatly exceeds what is shown in the music videos, immensely expanding upon and strengthening the meaning of their song lyrics and performances. The often called \textit{AU} or \textit{ATEEZ Universe} features a rich story with unique themes, adventures, rebellions, duality and pursuit of dreams. This story is told through music videos, song lyrics and additional content. The core complexity of self-development and resilience is delivered through metaphorical landscapes and unique character.

\subsection{The Treasure Series: Search for Freedom and Identity}
The Treasure Series is \textit{ATEEZ}'s debut arc and evolves around the idea of a treasure hunt. In this universe, the 8 members travel through adventurous dystopian worlds to find a hard-to grab treasure. This fleeting treasure is said to be the members' dreams, passion and sense for identity and symbolises the unversal human desire.\\

In their first music video \textit{"Pirate King"} \cite{ateez_pirateking}, the members are shown as modern pirates that travel through barren deserts and open seas. The picture telling and choreography show compasses, treasure maps and never-ending landscapes and underline \textit{ATEEZ}'s will to walk on their own path in an otherwhise unknown and hostile world. The sound and flow of the Song and album symbolise their rebellious spirit.\\

As the series progresses, songs like \textit{"Say My Name"} and \textit{"Hala Hala"} \cite{ateez_halahala} introduce darker tones and sounds. While \textit{"Say My Name"} symbolises courage, identity and the dream of recognition by inviting the listener to shout their name out loud, a figurative request of recognising \textit{ATEEZ}'s authenticity, \textit{"Hala Hala"} ilustrate societal expectations and personal doubt. In the music video, the members confront a group of eight masked men, symbolising repressed identities and individualities external presures, a recurring theme.\\

\textit{"Wave"} \cite{ateez_wave} and \textit{"Illusion"} \cite{ateez_illusion} bring a turning-point by showing moments of recovery and rest. The members are shown in a more lively manner, dreamlike scenarios, symbolising hope and companionship between the members. This heavy contrast tells the highs and lows of their journey and mirrors the real battle and struggle of following dreams.\\

\subsection{The Fever Series: Youth, Struggle and Duality}
ZERO: The \textit{Fever} series introduces an introspective and emotionally charged narrative. In this phase, \textit{ATEEZ} immerses itself int the complexity of Youth, passion and inner conflicts. The story shows immense contrasts such as light in the dark, hope and struggle and emphasizes the meaning of unity and self-conscience.\\

In \textit{"Inception"} \cite{ateez_inception} the borders between dream and reality mix and members appear trapped in surreal fragmented rooms. The repeating motive of fire symbolises both destruction and renewal, and reflects on their battle to overcome inner unrests in the search of inner purpose. This is further elaborated in the chapter \textit{"Answer"}, where the Group celebrates in ceremonial clothing their triumph, unity and adversity. The shadow visuals underlines their emotional duality.\\

\textit{"Thanxx"} \cite{ateez_thanxx} and \textit{"Deja Vu"} \cite{ateez_dejavu} expands upon this exploration of identity. \textit{"Thanxx"} rejects socialistic norms and expectations by adopting a rebellious tone. The lively visuals and unconventional backdrops represent their rejection of adapting to the societal norm while the lyrics emphasize to stay true to oneself. \textit{"Deja Vu"} is not at all like that, on the contrary. It shows the members trapped in a cycle of uncertainty and self-despair. This contradiction strongly reflects on the complexity of \textit{ATEEZ}'s emotions and struggle throughout the story of their journey.

\subsection{The World Series: Rebellion and Freedom}
\textit{The World} era which started with \textit{"Guerilla"} \cite{ateez_guerilla}, shows \textit{ATEEZ} in a new light. We once again can experience the freedom by fighting against the creativity and individuality-suppressing dystopia. \textit{The World} offers a wide variety blends of agressive energy and emotional depth. The possibly most well-known line \textit{"Break The Wall"} of the \textit{"Guerilla"} song lyrics are not only the climax in every concert, but also strongly symbolise the power that \textit{ATEEZ} holds to break down societal norms and destroy the dystopia they find themselves trapped inside of.
